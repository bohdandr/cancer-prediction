# General Conclusions:
# - The data was preprocessed by encoding categorical variables, generating patient profiles, and aggregating risk factors.
# - A Decision Tree classifier was used to predict cancer type based on encoded risk factors and their effects.
# - The model achieved a moderate accuracy, indicating room for further improvement through feature selection or advanced modeling techniques.
# - Visualizations helped in understanding the distribution of cancer types and effects, along with correlation analysis for feature relationships.
# - Future work can include hyperparameter tuning, testing other classification models, and incorporating additional patient-specific data for better predictions.
